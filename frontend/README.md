# Pet Adoption Frontend

The Pet Adoption Frontend is the client-side of the Pet Adoption App, built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to browse available pets for adoption, submit adoption requests and list their pets for adoption.

The app is designed to be responsive, user-friendly and visually appealing, using Material-UI for UI components and React Router for navigation.

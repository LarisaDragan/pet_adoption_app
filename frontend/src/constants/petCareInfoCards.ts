Bad breath can be a sure sign of dental disease, oral melanoma, and diabetes or kidney failure. Musky smelling ears are usually a sign of an ear infection. Stinky skin, accompanied at times with itchy, flaking skin or skin lesions, can be an indicator of allergies, seborrhea or bacterial or yeast infections. While you may be used to your pet producing malodorous gas on a regular basis, a change in the intensity of the smell can be a sign of gastrointestinal diseases. If your pet is displaying any of these signs, don’t wait: take your dog to the veterinarian for an examination.',
